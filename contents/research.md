### （1）Molecular Neuroscience — Calcium Channels/Calcium Signaling and the Regulation of Neural Function

钙通道和钙信号是神经科学领域的经典研究对象，有着长达几十年的研究历史，历久弥新。大多数生物学过程如发育、增殖、凋亡、转录、兴奋、学习记忆等均有钙离子参与，钙离子通过细胞膜离子通道（ion channel）或受体（receptor）进入神经元中并激活相关信号蛋白，进而调控一系列生理功能。在神经系统中，钙通道与钙信号更是与神经递质分泌、突起发育、神经网络形成及大脑高级活动息息相关。尽管我们已经发现了钙通道/钙信号与诸多病生理过程的明确关联，如神经元转录、发育、学习记忆，神经退化（神经退行性疾病）及神经功能紊乱（精神疾病）等，但该领域依然有诸多新现象和新问题亟需挖掘和回答。我们期待从新的角度探索钙通道和钙信号的运行模式及其对神经元功能的影响，以期对神经系统的运行机制提供新的见解；基于基础研究的突破，我们也尝试开发多种新方法调控钙通道、钙信号及神经元生理功能，包括理性设计的光、磁等非侵入式调控、基于蛋白质理性设计（rational design）和全新设计（de novo design）方法的通道蛋白及通道调控蛋白设计及调控等，为神经操控和脑疾病治疗带来新的方案。

Calcium channels and calcium signaling are classic research topics in neuroscience, with a history spanning several decades and continuing to yield new insights. Calcium ions are involved in most biological processes, including development, proliferation, apoptosis, transcription, excitation, and learning and memory. They enter neurons through membrane ion channels or receptors and activate downstream signaling proteins to regulate various physiological functions. In the nervous system, calcium channels and calcium signaling are particularly critical for neurotransmitter release, neurite outgrowth, neural network formation, and higher-order brain functions.

Although the connection between calcium channels/signaling and key pathophysiological processes—such as neuronal transcription, development, learning and memory, neurodegeneration (neurodegenerative diseases), and neural dysfunction (psychiatric disorders)—has been well established, many new phenomena and open questions remain to be explored. Our goal is to investigate the operating mechanisms of calcium channels and calcium signaling from new perspectives, and to understand their impact on neuronal function, with the aim of providing fresh insights into how the nervous system operates.

Building on breakthroughs in basic research, we are also developing novel methods to modulate calcium channels, calcium signaling, and neuronal physiological functions. These include non-invasive physical modulation tools such as light and magnetic fields, and the rational or de novo design of ion channel proteins and their modulators. These approaches aim to offer new strategies for neural modulation and the treatment of brain disorders.

生命体感受机械力刺激，进而调控相应生理过程。细胞中存在一系列力敏感蛋白（如力敏感通道等）通过力-钙转导等方式调控细胞兴奋性、转录特性及细胞命运。我们期待利用电生理、生物光学成像、细胞微纳操控、分子生物学、细胞生物学、生物化学及生物物理建模等方法在分子及细胞水平理解力-钙转导的具体运行机制，另一方面，我们也尝试运用合成生物学、蛋白质设计和生物材料等手段开发细胞和分子层面的力-钙转导监控及调节方法，以期实现细胞命运的力学操控和检测。

Living organisms sense mechanical stimuli and translate them into physiological responses. Within cells, a variety of mechanosensitive proteins (such as mechanosensitive ion channels) regulate excitability, transcriptional behavior, and cell fate through mechanisms like force-to-calcium transduction.

We aim to elucidate the mechanisms of force-to-calcium signaling at the molecular and cellular levels using a combination of electrophysiology, bio-optical imaging, micro/nanomanipulation, molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry, and biophysical modeling. In parallel, we are also developing new methods to monitor and regulate force-to-calcium transduction using synthetic biology, protein engineering, and biomaterials. Ultimately, we hope to enable mechanical control and sensing of cell fate decisions at both the molecular and cellular levels.
