Our lab is in a phase of rapid growth, with ample funding and stable research output. We warmly welcome students, research assistants, and postdoctoral candidates who are interested in our research areas to reach out proactively (yang.yaxiong@foxmail.com; yangyaxiong@sysu.edu.cn)! Specific requirements are as follows:

Master’s and Ph.D. Applicants:

Applicants should have a background in biology, chemistry, medicine, or engineering, with a strong passion for scientific research and a deep sense of curiosity. Lab interviews emphasize research capabilities, including familiarity with previous research projects, independent thinking, experimental skills, scientific reasoning, and literature comprehension. Publications are not the sole criterion.

Research Assistants:

Candidates should have obtained or be about to obtain a master’s degree in biology, chemistry, medicine, or a related engineering field. Competitive compensation will be provided. Outstanding research assistants will be given priority for Ph.D. admission within the group or receive full support in applying to other top-tier labs.

Postdoctoral Researchers:

Candidates should have obtained or be about to obtain a Ph.D. in biology, chemistry, medicine, or a related engineering discipline, and have published high-quality papers in the biomedical field as first author. Initial communication is welcome before preparing recommendation letters. Sun Yat-sen University offers competitive postdoctoral compensation packages and clear career development paths. Salary is negotiable.

Our lab is committed to offering personalized and comprehensive guidance and support tailored to each individual. We strive to foster the professional growth of every team member. I aim to be not only a mentor but also a trusted colleague, growing and advancing together with everyone in the lab.
